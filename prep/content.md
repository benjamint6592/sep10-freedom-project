## Inventions of the Future
* Solar-Fusion Phone
  * Utilizes artificial sun satellite to project energy into a micro-chamber in the phone
  * This allows the Solar-Fusion phone to refill battery in seconds
  * Phone locks onto the satellite's energy stream, not needing a charging port or any sort of cable for it's charging capabilities
  * Uses a theoretical "containment lattice", a three dimensional arrangement of ions in a crystalline solid to capture energy
  * The lattice converts the captured fusion particles from the Artificial Sun Satellite stream into electrical energy
  * Battery never degrades and sustains powers for decades
  * Phone is made out of a nano-material (extremely small)
  * Nano-material is able to optimize itself at an atomic level for the more efficient energy absorption
  * As the phone charges, the phone lets off a faint and soft orange/yellow glow, reminiscent of the sun in our solar system
  * The Solar-Fusion Phone's display photonic crystal screen
  * This screen is capable of bending light and refracting light to produce images with perfect lucidity, even in direct sunlight
  * Uses a solar-signature authentication system which uses a users light profile (their unique molecular reaction with photons) to unlock their device
  * This makes the Solar-Fusion phone to traditional hacking
  * The artificial sun satellite uses tight-beam microstreams (laser-like particles) in order to broadcast energy to one phone at a time
  * This leads to no energy spill that could interfere with radio telescopes, NASA communications, or other satellites.
