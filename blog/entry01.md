# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Nuclear Engineering)
##### 10/7/25

## Choosing a topic
The topic I decided for my Freedom Project is Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics for a variety of reasons. For one, using applied physics, one of my favorite classes in 9th grade, in my everyday work would never be boring, allowing you to constantly innovate and exercise your mind. To add on, being able to design, develop, and maintain the systems that bring millions of people energy makes me very accomplished in my success.

## Backup ideas
Before I settled on Nuclear Engineering, I consulted the idea of doing architecture, due to the fact you are able to design, innovate, and develop just like that of the role of a Nuclear Engineering and studying Applied Physics and structuring how to deliver energy on a daily basis.

## Articles I found interesting
Relating to the study of Applied Physics and Nuclear Engineering, some articles I found interesting on the topic include this [Pros and Cons of Being a Nuclear Engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/pros-cons-of-being-nuclear-engineer) article by Indeed, referring the pros and cons of being a Nuclear Engineer and if the skill set is right for you or not. Furthermore, this article by Columbia on their [Applied Physics Undergraduate Program](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/applied-physics-undergraduate-program) really enlightened me on the opportunities associated with the profession. Furthermore, this MIT article on [MIT's work with the Idaho National Laboratory and advances in the American Nuclear Industry](https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-work-with-idaho-national-laboratory-advances-america-nuclear-industry-0923) really piqued my interest, especially on their research with Small Modular Reactors, allowing for the first nuclear reactor in space.

## EDP
I believe we are on the first part of the Engineering Design Process, where we are finding what we are most passionate about and how we can apply it and use it in the Freedom Project. As aforementioned, I am doing Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics.

## Skills
Some skills I have developed from working on this blog are reducing procrastination, collaboration, and finding the best sources.

#### Reducing Procrastination
Since I have other projects to complete in this class, as well as numerous other classes, I have found it challenging to manage my time correctly to complete this project in my free time. To combat this, I have created a scheduling regimen to balance my aforementioned additionally projects and my workload, with completing this blog entry. I have found various people sharing similar experiences to me online that have been able to help me balance my time effectively and successfully *reduce procrasination*.

#### Collaboration
To successfully complete this assignment by the assigned due date, I have found it immensely helpful to work with and compare my "blogging" experiences with other classmates in the Software Engineering Program. Me and my peers have exchanged sources of information, especially with ones that are completing the same Freedom Project topic as me. Effectively *collaborating* is one of the most essential skills in everyday life, whether it be in schoolwork or working outside of school in order to drastically reduce complications with challenging assignments and constructively engage socially.

#### Finding the Best Sources
During my research for sources surrounding my topic of Nuclear Engineering, it was difficult to find the best and most reputable sources to list as part of the study of Applied Physics and Nuclear Engineering. DUring my browsing and searching for the best sources, I consulted numerous websites, universities, and data bases to find their perspectives and how they discussed Applied Physics and Nuclear Engineering as a topic, and how it compared to how I wanted to learn and inform others about it. This helped me *find the best sources* for this blog entry.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to diving into my topic and what it will bring to the table.
