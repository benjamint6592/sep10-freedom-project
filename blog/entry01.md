# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Nuclear Engineering)
##### 10/7/25

## Choosing a topic
The topic I decided for my Freedom Project is Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics for a variety of reasons. For one, using applied physics, one of my favorite classes in 9th grade, in my everyday work would never be boring, allowing you to constantly innovate and excercise your mind. To add on, being able to design, develop, and maintain the systems that bring millions of people energy makes me very accomplished in my success.

## Backup ideas
Before I settled on Nuclear Engineering, I consulted the idea of doing architecture, due to the fact you are able to design, innovate, and develop just like that of the role of a Nuclear Engineering and studying Applied Physics and structuring how to deliver energy on a daily basis.

## Articles I found interesting
Relating to the study of Applied Physics and Nuclear Engineering, some articles I found interesting on the topic include this [Pros and Cons of Being a Nuclear Engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/pros-cons-of-being-nuclear-engineer) article by Indeed, refering the pros and cons of being a Nuclear Engineer and if the skill set is right for you or not. Furthermore, this article by Columbia on their [Applied Physics Undergraduate Program](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/applied-physics-undergraduate-program) really enlightened me on the opportunities associated with the profession.
