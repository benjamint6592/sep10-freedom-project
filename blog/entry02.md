### What I found 
Recently in SEP, we found out which software and hardware technologies are currently available and are being developed for the future for our topic, with mine being Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics. We used the Google search engine to make queries about our topics to research and investigate what researchers, scientists, connoisseurs, and others are working on for our assigned subject. Some information I have gathered regarding the software and hardware technologies I found in my topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics include [A fresh set of eyes of Next Generation Nuclear Reactors](https://www.anl.gov/article/a-fresh-set-of-eyes-on-nextgeneration-nuclear-reactors) for software, where it shows how researchers are working towards new designs and technology with specialized software from leading technology companies like Nvidia and Intel to design advanced AI systems and Supercomputers for nuclear engineering modeling and simulation. Additionally, I looked into the [CASMO5 Nuclear Simulation Software](https://www.studsvik.com/key-offerings/nuclear-simulation-software/software-products/casmo5/) where I saw how CASMO5 ran advanced nuclear simulations Dual-Core Processors with 4 GB Available Memory software to run it. Thirdly, when looking into hardware, [Avalanche's Fusion Hardware Technology](https://www.avalanchefusion.com/technology) showed me how innovating companies like Avalanche used special pieces of hardware like the Orbitron for compact fusion.

### How I found it
While researching for my freedom project topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics, I had to pay important attention to what I searching for to find the information regarding software and hardware technologies. When I found the source of *A fresh set of eyes of Next Generation Nuclear Reactors*, I searched Current-Nuclear Engineering and New Innovation to see what innovations in Nuclear Tech and Software are led by Scientists of our generation and the previous ones in working towards a new future and what we have already done in working towards a Nuclear world. Furthermore, when I found the source *CASMO5 Nuclear Simulation Software*, I searched simulating Nuclear Energy, to specifically look into how Nuclear Reactors are being developed using current software companies who aim to innovate in the Nuclear Industry. Lastly, when I discovered the source *Avalanche's Fusion Hardware Technology*, I searched Nuclear Fusion hardware, to see how theoretical concepts like Fusion could be implemented in future Nuclear Hardware everywhere.

## EDP
In this part of the engineering design process, we are learning about how to code in CSS, and how to apply it in website building which we are currently doing with our movie website. I assume we are going to use this information to build our Freedom Project websites about our assigned projects with our knowledge of CSS, and our knowledge of HTML as well, which we previously worked on. This is ultimately the part of the Engineering Design process in the later parts of the research phase and beginning to brainstorm how we are going to apply our research.

## Skills
Some skills I have developed from working on this blog are critical thinking, adaptability, and effective communication.

### Critical thinking
While researching and writing my blog, I found multitudes of conflicting information and complex ideas related to my topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics. I learned to analyze the sources I looked into more carefully and check the credibility of the sites I linked. In total, critical thinking made me understand my topic better and present accurate information about software and hardware in my blog.

### Adaptability
As I progressed forward in my blog, I had to withstand deadlines and changing circumstances in my everyday life. I learned to adjust quickly to fulfill deadlines and the rubric assigned to the Freedom Project blog. Adaptability made me stay organized and help me meet goals on time to progress forward with my learning and lower my procrastination, adding onto my aforementioned skills from entry 1 of my blog.

### Communication
As I wrote the blog, it helped me understand how to communicate my ideas more clearly and use the sources I searched effectively in my documentation of progressing through my Freedom Project. I practiced using language that fit what I wanted to put through to the reader, structure my blog according to the rubric and most efficiently, and get feedback from my classmates to improve to the best of my ability using constructive criticism, and applying it to the language I used and the tone of the blog. Communication significantly impacted how I share ideas with others not just in the blog, but in my everyday life as well.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to learning more about HTML and CSS and be an efficient learner.
