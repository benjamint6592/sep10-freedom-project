### Brainstorming Part B
Recently in SEP, we continued working on our Freedom Project. In my freedom project, I was finalizing the content preperations for my website as I worked on Part B. I looked towards inventions that could theoretically exist that related to my topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics. During brainstorming, I use previous projects of mine like my Part A where I researched software and hardware technologies that could be helpful in brainstorming a theoretical future invention for my topic, as seen here in my [Freedom Project Synthesis of Part A](https://github.com/benjamint6592/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/content.md). Furthermore, I looked back on my previous blogs to see how I connected the hardware and software technologies I research to my Freedom Project topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics to more efficiently write this blog and recall my engineering design process, as seen here in [Blog 2](https://github.com/benjamint6592/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry02.md)  Using the technologies of our time and harnessing my previous efforts of diving into Nuclear Fusion/Applied Physics, I eventually came to the conclusion of a futuristic solar phone that charged from an Artificial Sun satellite above Earth's atmosphere, not requiring a wire connection to charge while harnessing the Artificial Sun's nuclear fusion state.

## EDP
In this part of the engineering design process, we are looking how to apply AVD in our webpages, creating an informational website on a topic we selected on Free Code Camp. In the Freedom Project, we are currently culiminating our previous efforts of synthesizing Part A and Part B of our Freedom Project webpage plan into a singular website, creating a timeline of past, current, and theoretical technologies like my Artificial Solar Fusion phone I aforementioned in my Brainstorming of Part B. I look forward to see how we will apply this in our webpages and how I will grow as a coder and a learner. 

## Skills
Some skills I have developed from working on this blog are writing skills, technical communication, and reflection.

### Writing Skills
As I combined information from multiple sources and my brainstorming notes in my brainstorming of Part B while writing this blog, I became better at synthesis writing skills, creating a clear and cohesive explanation about how I created Part B for my future Freedom Project webpage about my assigned topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics.

### Technical Communication
As I explained complex ideas like Nuclear Fusion, Artificial Suns, and Theoretical technologies in my explanation of how I brainstormed Part B while writing this blog, I learned skills of how to summarize complex ideas and explain them to a general audience who is not well versed in my assigned Freedom Project topic of Nuclear Engineering/Applied Physics.

### Reflection
As I thought about my engineering design process and recognized how my past works infulenced my brainstorming of Part B of my Freedom Project and my current decisions of writing this Blog and thinking about what we are doing in class and how it is effecting my coding skills and learning ability, I have developed skills of Reflection.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward to finishing my AVD animation and project and going forward in our Engineering Design Process.
